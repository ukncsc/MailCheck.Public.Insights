**Important Note**

This is a new feature with Mail Check analysing your DMARC reporting and producing the deductions above. Caveats as follows:
- Due to particular system limitations, it may not be possible to configure SPF and DKIM for every provider. It is best to apply both, but you can still pass a DMARC check with either just SPF or DKIM.
- Mail Check may not be listing all your systems. Mail Check only lists systems that contribute &gt; 10 emails and &gt; 1% of your total emails in the last 30 days, so you should still [review your DMARC reporting](https://www.mailcheck.service.ncsc.gov.uk/app/domain-security/test.gov.uk/custom/0001-01-01/9999-12-31/false/emailtraffic), to see if there are any further lower volume systems that need configuring with SPF and DKIM.
- You may have fixed an issue listed above, but because Mail Check is reviewing emails for the last 30 days, this will still remain on the list for a short period.</value>

    <value>Looking at your DMARC reporting in the last 30 days, 100% of your emails are passing DMARC. Note this applies to emails from testDomain but not sub-domains (see separate DMARC Insights).

**You should start considering how and when you will move to a DMARC policy of ‘Quarantine’**

A DMARC policy of quarantine will ensure that malicious spoofed emails that fail SPF and DKIM checks are sent to Junk folders.

You should consider the following:

- Are all your email sending systems* on testDomain configured with SPF and/or DKIM?
  
  - If yes, then you can proceed with moving your policy to ‘quarantine’
    
  - If no, then continue to configure SPF and DKIM first before moving to a policy of quarantine
    
- Are your sub-domain traffic passing DMARC and ready for a quarantine policy too?
  
  - If yes, then you can apply a policy of quarantine (p=quarantine) that applies to example.gov.uk and any sub-domains
    
  - If no, then you should keep your sub-domains on a policy of ‘none’. To do this you will need to include both ‘p=quarantine’ and ‘sp=none’ in your policy, where sp=none keeps your sub-domains with a DMARC policy of none for the time being.
    
- Have you read [our guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/email-security-and-anti-spoofing/mark-spoof-emails-as-spam)? This covers considerations about how to engage stakeholders and ‘dial up’ to a full quarantine policy.
  

***Note:** DMARC Insights only highlights systems that contribute &gt; 10 emails and &gt; 1% of overall traffic per month, so you should consider checking [your DMARC reporting]({4}/app/domain-security/{1}/custom/{2:yyyy-MM-dd}/{3:yyyy-MM-dd}/false/emailtraffic) if there are lower volume systems that still might need to be configured.</value>
